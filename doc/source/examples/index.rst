Examples
========

This is a collection of examples on advanced uses of opdelft.

The examples here is to show how to use the optimisation algorithms with real problems (e.g., Delft3D models). A simple Delft3D-FLOW model f34 from the Delftare website the https://oss.deltares.nl/web/delft3d/source-code is used as an examples. Note the f34 model here is very simple just for the demo purpose and should not be used for scientific purpose.

To learn more about the files of the f34 model, one can refer to the Deflt3D-FLOW manual https://oss.deltares.nl/documents/183920/185723/Delft3D-FLOW_User_Manual.pdf
