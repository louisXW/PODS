Calibrate Delft-FLOW Problem with DYCORS in Parallel
====================================================

This section is to show how to use pySOT inside opdelft on real problems in parallel. The algorithm used in the example is DYCROS. Both the scenario working with single objective problem and multiple objectives problem (2 objectives as an example) are shown.
