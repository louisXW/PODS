Welcome to opdelft!
===================================
opdelft is an optimisation toolbox for the calibration of expensive environmental models (e.g., Delft3D models). Environmental problems are usually complicate since there are usually massive model input and output files. In addition, these models are usually computationally expensive to run. These features make the implementation of advanced algorithm on these problems difficult.  The opdelft toolbox provides a framework coupling the advanced optimisation methods (e.g., surrogate optimisation algorithms, evolution algorithms) with real problems. The problems used here for demo in the example is Delft3D models. With minor modification opdelft can be used for the optimisation of other real problems.
