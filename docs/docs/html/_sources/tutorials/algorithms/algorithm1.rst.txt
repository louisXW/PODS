DYCORS
======

DYCORS (DYnamic COordinate search using Response Surface models) is a surrogate-based algorithm for optimization of HEB (High-dimensional, Expensive, and Black-box) problems.

The implementation of DYCORS is available is pySOT for both serial and parallel verison.

The synchronous parallelization with multiprocessing python model is implementited in opdelft.
