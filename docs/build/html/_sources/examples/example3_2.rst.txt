Use Dynamically Normalized Objective Function
=============================================

This is an demo to use the Parallel in parallel for the calibraiton of the Delft3D problem with Dynamically Normalized Function. The experiment setting of the algorithm is the same with example in :ref:`example3_1` case. The optimization problem funciton setting is the same as described in example using DYCORS in parallel with Dynamically Normalized objective Function.
